in the spring of twenty sixteen around nineteen million people in the united states visited a restaurant and a further forty nine million visited a fast food restaurant where a peish bunch when we read above the health consequences of eating out it tends to involve obesity par disease diabetes and the like but the latest study provides us with an entirely new reason to worry as if we needed any more the paper which is now published in the journal environment international introducee concern to the dinner plate it comes in the shape of a difficult to pronounce chemical saletta a group of chemical commonly found in food packaging and other materials do used in food processing they are often added to plastic to increase their flexibility durability and transparency angrily if you manufacture plastics you love valley durindal useful color and odorless tensure that a plastic product continued to do its job for up to fifty years but all that glitters is not gold dallied have the potential to cause a peeble in the human body in particular talleth to disrupt hormones while the exact effects of lanternes or unclear they seem to negatively impact the reproductive system of animals in possibly humans because that lad have the potential to interfere with metabolic processes come sientes have even wondered whether they might play a roll in the current obesity of the demi however more research will be needed before thalata any blame for that particular public health to nome the laterunt agate valley in humans was led by a means oda in assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the george washington university in washington d see and julia vachaspati from the university of california berkeley school of public health in a previous study the same team of valleyed investigators found that those who ate the highest quantities of fast food had valley levels up to forty per cent higher than those who aid fast food less frequently for their next foray into food chemicals the scientists cast their net a little wider they assessed whether eating out in general not just fast food would have the same impact they took dat of from the national health and nutrition examination survey which were collected in two thousand five to twenty fourteen in all the ten thousand two hundred fifty three participants were asked about their food consumption in the path twenty four hours more specifically whether it had been home cooked or eaten out this study is the first to comparitavely out and those who eat home cooked meals and i am sad to report the findings are a little concerning individuals who reported consuming more restaurant cafeteria in fast food meals had valley levels almost thirty five per cent higher than people who mostly ate food purchased from a grocery store zedekias this study suggests food prepared at home as less likely to contain high levels of dale chemicals lingouti lity problems pregnancy complications and other health issues over all sixty one per cent of participants had eaten out the day before they completed the questioners and perhaps most worrying although the link between eating out and vallie exposure were significant in all age groups the most robust links were found in teenagers adolescent who regularly at out had fifty five per cent higher tally levels than people who hated home so potentially at a time when hormones are at their busiest valley levels are at their highest in particular cheeseburger and other sandwich eaters seem to pay the heftiest toll burgers and sandwiches purchased from cafeterias restaurants or fast food outlets were associated with thirty per cent higher tale in people of all ages for me this is the most sobering finding i am a huge fan of purchasing burgers that being shed pregnant women children and teams are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of harmon disrupting chemicals so it's important to find was to limit their exposures future studies should investigate the most effective interventions to remove valley from the foods apply julia arshavski ph d because temanite eat out regularly these results are worried them to say the least so where do these pesky salad come from unfortunately there are many ways that they may find their way into your burgher for instance they are present in take out boxes plastic gloves and a range of food processing equipment that might be used at restaurants what should we do the answer according to soda might be relatively simple preparing food at home may represent a wind wind for consumers home cooked meals can be a good way to reduce sugar unhealthy fat and salt and she continues this studies suggested may not have as many harmful vallais a restaurant meal in reality you as individuals are not likely to switch intirely to home cooked meals over night and it'll take more than a dose of endocrines raptors to put most people of their talk as essentially this will come down to a change in legislation if the results are replicated in the relationship between eating out and vallies confirmed new policy may need to be introduced to protect consumers not
