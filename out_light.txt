 The technique is also known as resetting your breath or four-square breathing 
It is easy to do quick to learn and can be a highly effective technique for people in stressful situations 
 People with high-stress jobs such as soldiers and police officers often use box breathing when their bodies are in fight-or-flight mode 
This technique is also relevant for anyone interested in re-centering themselves or improving their concentration 
 Read on to discover the four simple steps required to master box breathing and to learn more about other deep breathing techniques 
 Box breathing is a simple technique that a person can do anywhere including at a work desk or in a cafe 
Before starting people should sit with their back supported in a comfortable chair and their feet on the floor 
 If someone finds the technique challenging to begin with they can try counting to three instead of four 
Once someone is used to the technique they may choose to count to five or six 
 Mark Divine is a former Navy SEAL commander who has been using the technique since 1987 
In the video below he describes how to use box breathing 
 Resetting ones breath or working to make the breath leave fight-or-flight mode is good for both the mind and body 
 The unconscious body or the autonomic nervous system refers to the functions that take place without any thought such as the heart beating or the stomach digesting food 
This system can be in a fight-or-flight or rest-and-digest state 
 In fight-or-flight mode the body feels threatened and reacts to help the person escape or avoid a threatening situation 
Among other things the body releases hormones to make the heart beat faster breathing to quicken and to boost blood sugar levels 
 Having this state of stress activated too often or for too long has adverse consequences on health however 
The physical impact of this state can cause wear and tear on every system in the body 
 Long-term stress can increase the risk of conditions that include The ability to consciously regulate breath allows the body to leave a state of stress and enter into a state of calm 
 Box breathing could provide a number of benefits to those that use it 
 Mark who is the creator of the SEALFIT and Unbeatable Mind fitness programs spoke to MNT about how the technique has helped him in stressful times  I used it every day in SEAL trainingit helped me graduate as the honor man the] number one graduate 
Now I use it for every challenging situation and practice it daily Below are four potential benefits of box breathing with research to support the claims 
 Reduces physical stress symptoms in the body Deep breathing techniques have been shown to significantly reduce the production of hormones associated with stress such as cortisol 
 In one study  participants showed lower levels of cortisol after deep breathing as well as increased attention levels 
 Mark was also keen to emphasise this 
He stated that box breathing bleeds off excess stress and gives you a handy on-demand tool to avoid taking on any more stress than you can handle Positively affects emotions and mental well-being According to some studies  the use of breathing techniques can be useful in the reduction of anxiety  depression  and stress 
 Increases mental clarity energy and focus One study was able to show that breathing techniques could bring about better focus and a more positive outlook 
 Participants in the study were also more able to manage impulses such as those associated with smoking and other addictive behaviors 
 Improves future reactions to stress Studies suggest that box breathing may have the ability to change someones future reactions to stress 
 Researchers have even suggested that relaxation response practices such as meditation deep breathing and yoga  can alter how the body reacts to stress by changing how certain genes are switched on 
 Genes have different roles within the body 
The study found that relaxation response practices boosted the activation of genes associated with energy and insulin  and reduced the activation of genes linked to inflammation and stress 
 According to the study this effect occurs in both in short-term and long-term practitioners of these techniques 
However the effect is more significant in long-term users 
  Once someone experiences the physical psychological and emotional benefits of box breathing they will want to do it daily Mark Divine There are a number of steps that people can take to make box breathing easier  
 Psychopathy is generally considered to be a personality disorder  
 Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM does not formally acknowledge psychopathy as a standalone condition it incorporates it under the wider antisocial personality disorder But what is a psychopath In 1993  Canadian psychologist Robert Hare the creator of the famous Hare Psychopathy Checklist defined psychopaths as social predators who charm manipulate and ruthlessly plow their way through life Completely lacking in conscience and feeling for others he goes on to say psychopaths selfishly take what they want and do as they please violating social norms and expectations without the slightest sense of guilt or regret Does any of this sound familiar The stereotypical portrait of the psychopath may call to mind such fictional characters as Hannibal Lecter or even real personalities such as the serial killers Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer 
However some argue that most psychopaths live among us 
 According to recent estimates just below 1 percent of non-institutionalized males in the United States are psychopaths 
 Despite this small percentage people who have psychopathy are 20–25 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-psychopaths and half of all violent crimes in the US 
are committed by psychopaths 
 That said if you feel as though this definition could easily fit your boss or your neighbor you might be right 
In his book Snakes in Suits  Hare argues that psychopaths are more numerous than we might think many of them fitting perfectly and even thriving in the corporate world or that of politics 
 N]ot all psychopaths are killers Hare writes 
They are more likely to be men and women you know who move through life with supreme self-confidence — but without a conscience In this article we will attempt to find out exactly what goes on inside the brain of such supremely confident yet conscienceless people 
Is there such a thing as a neurological explanation for callousness Can anything be done to correct it A marked lack of empathy is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with psychopathy explains Jean Decety the Irving B 
Harris Professor in psychology and psychiatry at the University of Chicago in Illinois and a world-renowned expert on the neuroscience of empathy 
 Several studies have suggested the neural basis for empathy is either faulty or lacking altogether in the psychopathic brain 
 Research has indicated that psychopaths might have an impaired mirror neuron system — that is difficulties with the neurons that in a healthy brain activate both when we perceive someone else doing an action and when we do that same action ourselves 
 Other now classic studies have found reduced volumes of gray matter in the brains so-called paralimbic system — the conglomerate of brain regions responsible for emotion regulation and self-control setting goals and staying motivated in the face of delayed gratification 
 More recently Prof 
Decety has led several experiments that suggest that psychopaths simply lack the neural equipment for empathy 
 He and his team scanned the brains of 121 inmates held in a US 
medium-security prison while they were shown images of painful situations 
The study participants were also assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised PCL-R 
 When the participants deemed highly psychopathic were asked to imagine that the pain was inflicted on them the relevant brain areas known to be linked with emotion processing and empathy for pain did light up in the functional  MRI  machine 
 These brain areas are the anterior insula the anterior midcingulate cortex somatosensory cortex and the right amygdala 
 However when the highly psychopathic individuals were asked to imagine that somebody else was experiencing pain the same brain areas failed to respond 
 Also the study found that the participants insulae and ventromedial prefrontal cortices vMPFC failed to connect when the participants had to take the perspective of another 
 The vMPFC  also known as the social hub of our brain is an area involved in empathetic decision making — that is it helps us to weigh decisions that benefit either ourselves or others — and in attributing feelings and thoughts to other people 
 But it seems that in the case of psychopaths the neural circuits that would have to activate during empathy are just faulty making psychopaths ill-equipped for this basic human emotion 
 Some have suggested that psychopaths are not evil justreally bad at making decisions 
Joshua Buckholtz an associate professor of psychology at Harvard University in Cambridge MA and his colleagues scanned the brains of 49 inmates held in two medium-security prisons while asking them to complete a delayed gratification test 
 This is a situation wherein they had to choose between receiving less money immediately or more money later on 
 They found that a brain area called the ventral striatum — a region tied to evaluating the value of immediate rewards — was overly active in participants deemed highly sociopathic on the PCR-L scale 
Psychopaths then might simply overestimate the value of their immediate rewards 
 This finding also correlates with the aforementioned work regarding the key role of the vMPFC in psychopathy 
The vMPFC explain Buckholtz and his colleagues controls the reward-processing ventral striatum 
 So if we want but in order to get that wed have to kill someone our vMPFC can tell the ventral striatum Hang on a minute! You may want to reassess that trade-off — is it really worth taking someone elses life for money And can you bear the consequences of your actions But Buckholtz and colleagues found that in psychopathic brains the vMPFC and the ventral striatum are not communicating 
 As he explains  The striatum assigns values to different actions without much temporal context 
We need the prefrontal cortex to make prospective judgments about] how an action will affect us in the future — If I do this then this bad thing will happen  I]f you break that connection in anyone theyre going to start making bad choices because they wont have the information that would otherwise guide their decision-making to more adaptive ends 
 However there are many natural methods that women can use to encourage labor to begin once the pregnancy has reached full term 
 In this article we cover the risks of breaking your water and provide alternative ways to induce labor safely 
 There are no proven safe ways for a woman to break her water at home 
It can be dangerous if the water breaks before natural labor begins or before the baby is fully developed 
 During the natural process of labor the water breaks when the babys head puts pressure on the amniotic sac causing it to rupture 
Women will notice either a gush or a trickle of water coming out of the vagina 
 Many doctors say that women must give birth within 12–24 hours of the water breaking 
After this time a doctor may recommend a cesarean delivery to ensure the safety of the woman and the baby 
 This is because it is easier for bacteria to get into the uterus after the water breaks 
This increases the risk of infection which is a major complication that puts both the woman and the baby at risk 
It may also make the birth more difficult 
 It is particularly dangerous to use artificial instruments to rupture the amniotic sac as this can introduce bacteria into the uterus and cause infections 
It could also injure the baby 
 Labor can begin without the water breaking 
As a result women can speed up or induce labor naturally without breaking their water 
 In some cases a doctor can help a womans water to break using a procedure called an amniotomy 
They will insert a device into the vagina and very carefully use it to break the amniotic sac 
 Before carrying out an amniotomy the doctor will ensure that the baby is head-down and that the procedure is safe for both the woman and the baby 
 Most women will not need an amniotomy to induce labor 
However it is usually safe and provides an alternative or additional option to using medication 
 An amniotomy may not be safe for every woman 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG recommend against a woman having an amniotomy when her labor is progressing normally and the baby appears to be in good health 
 Apart from an amniotomy doctors can induce labor by using a catheter to dilate the cervix or by prescribing medication such as Pitocin 
 The World Health Organization WHO say that attempts to induce labor may be harmful if there are no medical reasons to justify them 
This includes efforts to speed up the water breaking 
 Allowing a woman to go into labor naturally can lower the risk of complications and minimize the likelihood of unwanted labor interventions such as cesarean deliveries 
 Women whose doctors recommend breaking their water should ask questions about the risks and benefits and get clear details about how this might affect their options during labor 
 Any intervention to induce labor will present benefits and risks 
 For some people  the risks of remaining pregnant may be greater than the risks of inducing labor 
For others it is safer to wait 
 It is essential to discuss each pregnancy with a doctor to determine the best course of action 
 The end of pregnancy can be exhausting 
People believe that there are many ways to induce labor from eating spicy food to going for long walks 
 There is little evidence to support most of these ideas 
However the following methods may safely help to induce labor if the womans body is ready 
 Women should only consider using these techniques to encourage the natural onset of labor once the pregnancy has reached full term 
They should also confirm first with a doctor that their pregnancy is low risk 
 Having sex particularly vaginal penetration may help to start labor 
It is not clear whether this is due to hormonal changes physical stimulation or something else 
 A 2014 study found a link between having sex during the last week of pregnancy and going into labor 
Women whose water has already broken should not have sex as this can increase the risk of infection 
 Nipple stimulation may be a natural way to get the body to release oxytocin  a hormone that plays a key role in both labor and breast-feeding 
 Learn more about how nipple stimulation can induce labor  
 A small 2011 study asked women to eat six dates per day during the last 4 weeks of their pregnancy 
 The researchers found that 96 percent of the women who ate dates had spontaneous labor compared to 79 percent of those who did not 
The women who ate dates also had greater dilation of their cervix during labor 
 The risks of inducing labor at home depend on the chosen method 
 Natural methods that do not expose the baby to new chemicals tend to be the safest 
These include having sex or stimulating the nipples 
 Nutritional and herbal remedies can be dangerous especially if a woman eats large quantities of herbs or is not aware of the possible side effects 
 Any food that a woman consumes during labor can affect the baby so it is essential to talk to a doctor before trying any herbal or dietary remedies 
 Some women try to induce labor with intense physical activity such as playing a sport 
Exercise is generally safe during pregnancy although there is little evidence to suggest that it can induce labor 
 Women who have not exercised during their pregnancy should not begin an intense exercise regimen at this late stage 
It is also vital to avoid falling or doing anything that could impact on the abdomen 
 The last few weeks of pregnancy can be challenging 
Many women who are giving birth for the first time will go past their due date 
This may be worrying but it is common and is not likely to harm the baby 
 Almost all women eventually go into labor on their own 
While the waiting can be tough it is generally safest to wait for the natural onset of labor 
A doctor will be able to provide advice for each individual 
 Women with specific risk factors such as hypertension or gestational diabetes  may need a doctor to induce their labor 
 Women may also need a labor induction if there are any signs that the baby is distressed 
In such cases inducing labor safely may increase the likelihood of vaginal birth and a healthy baby 
 Women should discuss their concerns with their doctor and ask them to explain the benefits and risks of each option 
Women should also be aware of what to expect during the onset of labor and how to get hold of their doctor if they suspect that they might be in labor 
  
 Monosodium glutamate MSG is a food additive that enhances flavor 
It is commonly used in restaurants and pre-packaged foods 
 While there are many anecdotal reports of MSG-induced symptoms scientific research into the syndrome is limited 
 As a result the use of MSG remains controversial 
Some Chinese restaurants advertise as being MSG-free 
 Read on to learn more about MSG symptom complex and the health effects of this additive 
 The term Chinese restaurant syndrome is no longer in professional use though some people may still use the phrase to explain their symptoms 
 Reported symptoms include Sometimes symptoms can be severe 
A case report published in the Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine described a 23-year-old man who experienced severe swelling in the mouth after eating Chinese food 
He was unable to speak and had serious difficulty swallowing saliva 
 While MSG symptom complex is likely related to MSG intake researchers are still not entirely sure what causes the symptoms 
 While MSG may not affect everyone it appears that some people are extremely sensitive to it or other food additives 
 MSG is made from glutamate which is one form of glutamic acid an amino acid that is naturally present in many foods 
 The human body also produces glutamate and requires it for several functions including learning and memory 
 MSG is used to enhance flavor and it is commonly added to Chinese food processed meats and canned goods 
 The United States Food and Drug Administration FDA consider MSG to be generally recognized as safe However because the FDA have received many reports of negative reactions to MSG the administration requires manufacturers to feature added MSG on food labels 
 Relatively few studies have investigated the effects of MSG especially in recent years 
 A study from 2000 included 130 people who self-reported as being sensitive to MSG 
They were administered MSG or a placebo  
 Of those participants 385 percent reacted to MSG only 131 percent reacted to the placebo only and 146 percent reacted to MSG and the placebo 
 The reactions were typically mild 
An increased dose of MSG without the presence of food was most likely to cause a reaction 
 However the researchers were unable to replicate the results when they repeated the test with the same of participants 
This suggests that outside factors such as food intake may have caused the reactions 
 In 2016 a review of studies concluded that eating MSG with food had no significant influence on the occurrence of headaches 
 However one study included in the review reported a significant link between the consumption of MSG and headaches in female participants 
 The authors concluded that overall the methods used could not produce reliable consistent results and that more research is needed 
 It is important to note that an organization that promotes the use of glutamate employs one of these authors 
 Researchers commonly administer MSG to mice to induce obesity  
In the past decade some people have wondered whether MSG intake is also linked to extra weight in humans 
 One study from 2011 found that MSG was associated with an increase in weight in healthy Chinese adults 
However there have been conflicting results  
 More research is needed to determine the effect of MSG on the body 
 People report various health issues that they associate with MSG 
According to a Korean study from 2014  the most common complaints were MSG symptom complex may also cause Severe and life-threatening symptoms are rare 
They resemble the symptoms of an allergic reaction and include People who experience severe symptoms should seek emergency medical attention 
 The treatment for MSG symptom complex varies depending on the symptoms and their severity 
 Mild symptoms typically clear up without treatment 
A person with these symptoms may benefit from A doctor may recommend OTC or prescription medications to relieve these symptoms 
Treatments include ïantihistamine medications for breathing problems facial swelling or an abnormal heartbeat ïa shot of epinephrine adrenaline for life-threatening reactions The only way to completely prevent MSG syndrome complex is to stop eating foods that contain the additive 
 People with very mild symptoms may be able to prevent them by only eating small amounts of foods that contain MSG 
 Anyone with a sensitivity to MSG should check whether it is included on food labels 
Remember to also check for the full name monosodium glutamate 
 The additive is usually present in MSG is also known as Some people prefer to eat at Chinese restaurants that are MSG-free 
Other kinds of restaurants also use MSG so it is essential to ask before ordering food 
 People who are very sensitive to MSG may also need to avoid foods that contain high amounts of natural glutamate 
 Natural glutamate is present in the following Avoiding natural glutamates may be challenging but a doctor or dietitian can provide guidance and develop a low-glutamate meal plan 
 A person should see a doctor if symptoms are severe or persistent 
 Anyone with breathing difficulties chest pain or swelling of the throat should seek emergency medical care 
 To assess a persons symptoms a doctor may ask Depending on the symptoms the doctor may also The effects of MSG syndrome complex usually pass quickly 
People often feel better within a few hours 
 In the meantime home remedies can alleviate discomfort 
 However anyone with a life-threatening reaction to MSG should carry an epinephrine shot such as those sold under the brand names Adrenaclick or EpiPen 
Be very careful when eating out or buying packaged or processed foods 
 A dietitian can help to determine which foods are safe 
  
 Other common causes include In this article we explore the common causes of both headaches and nausea as well as some underlying issues that are less common and more serious 
We also discuss treatments and ways to prevent the symptoms 
 Headaches are very common  and most people will experience one from time to time 
Nausea sometimes accompanies a headache and a number of health issues can cause this 
 Migraines represent the most common cause of both symptoms 
According to a 2015 review  around 1 in 7 people in United States experience migraines every year 
 A migraine feels like a moderate or severe headache 
The pain is often throbbing and located on one side of the head 
During a migraine a person may also experience Beyond migraines common causes of both headaches and nausea include Another common cause of a headache and nausea is low blood sugar which can result from Other causes of concurrent headaches and nausea are more severe and may require urgent medical treatment 
Understanding the full range of causes is essential as it can enable a person to seek the right treatment in time 
 Headaches and nausea are symptoms of the following severe conditions and injuries According to the findings of a 2013 review  over 60 percent of people with migraines also experience nausea and vomiting 
However the medical community is still unsure why migraines can cause nausea 
 One explanation is that migraines affect nerve pathways that stimulate the part of the brain that controls vomiting 
A 2014 study found that people experiencing migraines with nausea showed activity in the rostral dorsal medullary area of the brain which likely controls nausea 
 Another theory relates to serotonin  a chemical in the brain that affects According to a 2012 review  people with migraines sometimes have reduced serotonin levels which may also lead to nausea 
 Treatment for headaches and nausea depends on the cause 
If the cause is a migraine the following may help If a person has a severe sudden headache and no history of migraines they should speak with a doctor 
 See a doctor right away if a headache and nausea follow a blow to the head 
 Also seek medical attention if headaches grow worse over time or accompany any of the following symptoms It may not always be possible to prevent headaches and nausea 
However the following may help Migraines are the most common cause of headaches that occur with nausea 
Dehydration and low blood sugar are also frequently responsible 
 Some causes are more serious 
Several affect the brain such as meningitis brain aneurysms and tumors 
These issues typically feature additional symptoms 
 Anyone who is worried or unsure about the cause of their headaches and nausea should speak with a doctor 
  
 This article discusses the causes and symptoms of end-stage kidney disease ESKD which is also called end-stage renal disease ESRD or kidney failure 
 We also cover treatment prevention and ways to reduce the risk of developing ESKD 
 End-stage kidney disease or ESKD is the most advanced stage of chronic or long-term kidney disease which is when a person gradually loses kidney function over time 
 There are five stages of kidney disease 
ESKD is stage 5 
 When a person has ESKD their kidneys fail to function either wholly or partially 
Even if the kidneys work partially it is not enough to meet the bodys needs 
 The kidneys have an essential role in the body 
They filter out waste and excess water from the blood 
These waste products come out in a persons urine 
 If a person has ESKD waste products can build up in their blood and may become life-threatening 
 A person with ESKD will need kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant to save their life 
 A buildup of waste products in the blood causes the symptoms of ESKD 
The buildup occurs because the kidneys are no longer able to filter those waste products out of the blood sufficiently 
 A person with ESKD may experience Chronic kidney disease can slowly lead to kidney failure and ESKD but the kidneys may also stop working suddenly 
 If a person suddenly has kidney failure it is called acute renal failure or acute kidney injury 
 We explore the causes of ESKD as well as acute renal failure below According to the American Kidney Fund  diabetes and high blood pressure are the first and second most common chronic conditions that cause ESKD 
 Other chronic conditions that can cause ESKD include Acute renal failure is when the kidneys stop working suddenly 
This may occur due to ESKD is the most advanced stage of chronic or long-term kidney disease 
Chronic kidney disease affects between 10 and 16 percent of adults worldwide 
 Several factors increase the risk of chronic kidney disease including If a person has chronic kidney disease the following factors increase the risk it will progress to ESKD Reduced kidney function may affect many other parts of the body 
 Complications of ESKD include If a person has symptoms of ESKD a doctor may test their blood and urine for waste products 
These tests may include According to research from 2016  a doctor may diagnose ESKD if a person has uremia which is when the blood retains large amounts of substances that the kidneys usually remove in the urine 
Uremia means they will need ongoing kidney dialysis 
 Doctors will also look for a low GFR which tells them if the kidneys are not filtering a persons blood well 
 A doctor will usually suggest renal replacement therapy for ESKD 
Renal replacement therapy includes kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant 
 In 2013 more than 14 million people were receiving renal replacement therapy worldwide 
 There are two main types of kidney dialysis hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis 
 Hemodialysis is when a machine filters waste from a persons blood 
This process takes 3 or 4 hours and people have it done at a dialysis center 
A person with ESKD will usually use hemodialysis 2 or 3 times each week 
 During peritoneal dialysis a person pumps dialysis fluid into their abdomen 
The fluid draws out waste fluids through the lining of the abdomen which is known as the peritoneum 
The fluid comes out through a catheter 
Peritoneal dialysis can be done at home 
 A kidney transplant is when a surgeon replaces the damaged kidney with a healthy one from a donor 
 Alongside renal replacement therapy a person may need to follow a specific diet to support their treatment 
The diet may involve The following lifestyle changes may slow the progress of chronic kidney disease If a person has the symptoms of chronic kidney disease or ESKD they should see their doctor 
Getting the right treatment as soon as possible may improve the outlook for this conditions 
 Without kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant ESKD is life-threatening 
A person with ESKD that requires kidney dialysis will continue to use it long-term 

 Any disruption to the blood supply can damage the spinal cord and prevent it from communicating with the rest of the body 
 The spine uses nerve impulses to communicate with different parts of the body 
In severe cases of spinal stroke  the lack of communication can cause paralysis and may be life-threatening 
 Unlike other strokes spinal strokes do not typically disrupt the blood supply to the brain 
However they do have similar causes 
 The majority of spinal strokes are ischemic meaning that they result from blood clots in blood vessels 
 Less commonly bleeding from ruptured blood vessels can cause a spinal stroke 
This type of stroke is called a hemorrhagic stroke 
 Spinal strokes are rare accounting for just 125 percent of all strokes 
In this article learn about the symptoms causes treatment and recovery 
 The symptoms of spinal strokes may vary from person to person depending on the location of the stroke in the spine 
The severity of the damage will also influence the symptoms that a person experiences 
 The primary symptom of a spinal stroke is sudden extreme pain in the neck and back 
Other symptoms can include In severe cases a spinal stroke can cause death 
 The majority of spinal strokes occur due to changes in the shape of blood vessels 
For example blood vessel walls may thicken which will cause the vessels to narrow 
This can sometimes happen as a natural consequence of aging 
 However specific factors increase the likelihood of this happening including All of these factors put additional strain on the circulatory system increasing the chance of damaged or dysfunctional blood vessels 
 For example high blood pressure can damage and weaken blood vessels making them more likely to rupture and bleed 
This can cause a stroke 
 In some cases problems with the heart or the aorta can cause spinal strokes 
These problems include severely low blood pressure or a lack of blood flow through the aorta 
In rare cases tangled blood vessels can also cause a spinal stroke 
 Anyone experiencing a spinal stroke needs immediate medical attention and prompt diagnosis 
A doctor will ask a person about their symptoms if possible and carry out a physical examination 
 They will look for common indicators of a problem with the spinal cord such as weakness in the legs 
If a doctor suspects a spinal stroke an MRI is usually necessary to rule out other conditions that could damage the spinal cord 
 An MRI can also help to confirm the presence and location of a blockage or bleed 
 Treatment for a spinal stroke will depend on the underlying cause 
In cases of ischemic spinal stroke a doctor will give the person medications to thin the blood and reduce the risk of blood clots 
These are known as antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs 
They include common drugs such as aspirin  
 Medication may also be necessary to manage a persons symptoms as well as their risk factors for another stroke 
 For example for people with high blood pressure or high cholesterol a doctor may prescribe medication to control these factors 
 A person who has paralysis may benefit from occupational and physical therapy  which can make it possible to regain some range of motion 
 If a person loses control of their bladder they may need a urinary catheter 
 Spinal strokes can have severe long-term complications depending on the extent of the damage and the location of the stroke 
 Complications of a spinal stroke can include It is possible to make a full recovery from a spinal stroke 
The chances of making a full recovery depend on the cause and location of the stroke the extent of the damage the success of the treatment and the individuals overall health status 
 However many people will experience lasting complications after a spinal stroke and may require long-term treatment or have to implement lifestyle changes 
 For most people certain lifestyle changes are essential to reduce risk factors and improve the chances of a full recovery 
 These could include Many people make a full recovery from a spinal stroke but this can take months or even years 
 Paralysis following a spinal stroke may last for a few weeks or may be permanent 
 People can reach out to support groups and consider seeing a therapist to help their recovery and reduce stress  
  
 Ureaplasma bacteria are part of the bodys bacterial population and they live in balance without causing a problem in most cases 
Sometimes however they can increase in population  causing infection and health problems 
 Ureaplasma belongs to a class of bacteria known as Mycoplasma  
The Mycoplasma species are the smallest known organisms of their type that can make a copy of themselves to reproduce 
 Ureaplasma does not have a cell wall which makes it unique among bacteria 
The lack of a cell wall makes it resistant to some common antibiotics  including penicillin  
However it can be treated with others 
 Most people have Ureaplasma in their bodies and never know it 
But Ureaplasma has been linked to diseases and conditions that affect the male and female reproductive systems 
It can also infect newborns if the mother passes the bacteria to the infant during pregnancy 
 In this article we examine how Ureaplasma is spread the symptoms it can cause and what treatment options are available 
 Ureaplasma can be passed during sexual contact 
One study found that vaginal infections with Ureaplasma were higher among women who had multiple sexual partners 
 These bacteria may also be passed to a fetus or newborn if the mother has Ureaplasma infection during pregnancy 
 Ureaplasma may also be found in women who have never been sexually active according to another study  
 As such the cause of Ureaplasma presence may not be known in some cases 
 Ureaplasma does not cause symptoms if it is living in balance with other bacteria 
A healthy immune system can usually keep the bacteria in check preventing them from causing infection 
 If the Ureaplasma population increases certain health problems may develop and cause symptoms 
 The following symptoms are possible signs of Ureaplasma infection and should be checked by a doctor 
 People should note that Ureaplasma may not be the only cause of these issues 
 Trouble getting pregnant Ureaplasma bacteria have been found in both men and women with infertility problems 
Infertility is defined as trying to conceive for 12 months without success 
 The bacteria may affect the number of sperm and their ability to move in men 
In women it may cause an infection that makes pregnancy more difficult to achieve 
 A study found that a particular Ureaplasma known as Ureaplasma urealyticum is seen more often in women with unexplained infertility 
As a result the authors suggest that women with unexplained infertility should be tested for the bacteria 
 A genital tract infection may cause up to 15 percent of all cases of male infertility but not all of these are due to Ureaplasma 
Many of them are a result of sexually transmitted infections  such as chlamydia and gonorrhea  
 A review of research found that U 
urealyticum was associated with a higher risk of infertility in men 
Another type Ureaplasma parvum  was not linked to male infertility 
 Pain discharge and itching of the genital area Ureaplasma infection may cause some conditions that lead to pain and discomfort in the genital area 
They include Pelvic or abdominal pain Ureaplasma has been linked to several different health problems that can cause pain in the pelvic abdominal or groin area 
These include Premature babies especially those that weigh 1000 grams about 22 pounds or less may be more prone to Ureaplasma infection 
 Newborns may develop Also a fetus can become infected with Ureaplasma before birth which can lead to Pregnant women can be treated for Ureaplasma infections which greatly reduces the chance of these complications 
 A biopsy or swab which is tested in a lab is used to diagnose Ureaplasma 
The biopsy or swab may be taken from the vagina uterine lining urethra or urine sample 
 Due to its small size Ureaplasma is nearly impossible to see under a microscope 
Identifying Ureaplasma requires specialized lab tests and equipment 
 Antibiotic treatment is needed for infections of Ureaplasma 
Only certain antibiotics are effective against these bacteria however 
 The antibiotic chosen depends upon the health problem being addressed and who is being treated 
Certain antibiotics are not safe for pregnant women or newborns 
 Urinary tract or genital infections caused by Ureaplasma may be treated with azithromycin or doxycycline 
 If the bacteria do not respond to these drugs erythromycin or fluoroquinolones may be used 
 Newborns with lung problems caused by Ureaplasma may be treated with erythromycin 
 Pregnant women who have premature rupture of membranes may be treated with macrolide antibiotics 
These include clarithromycin azithromycin and erythromycin 
 Treatment with an antibiotic may reduce the risk of Ureaplasma infection in the newborn 
 Only abstaining from sexual contact can prevent Ureaplasma transmission 
But some people may have Ureaplasma colonization without having sex 
 Ureaplasma is considered an opportunistic bacteria which means it is found in both healthy people and those with certain diseases 
 Opportunistic bacteria may be able to make someone sick when an illness stress  or other opportunity weakens the immune system and allows it to multiply and further invade the body

 While there is little research supporting the benefits of egg yolks for hair there are many websites dedicated to natural beauty remedies for the hair and scalp including eggs 
 Read on for more information about what people say about benefits of egg yolks for healing the hair 
 Egg yolks are the round yellow portion of the egg 
The yolk contains several components that could enrich the hair 
 Below are two possible benefits that egg yolks could offer the hair 
It is important to note that there is little scientific evidence to back up these claims 
 Hair growth Some natural beauty proponents claim that applying egg yolks to the hair can stimulate hair growth 
They contend the yolks stimulate the scalp and nourish the hair roots 
 One of the key elements of egg yolk is sulfur which is an important component of hair 
There are 1645 milligrams mg of sulfur per 100 grams g of egg yolk 
 However no research has shown egg yolk application is an effective method to reduce the incidence of hair loss or promote new hair growth 
 Dry hair One of the key elements of egg yolks is the protein they contain which may be nourishing and shine promoting 
The yolk is also high in fat which is why it can enhance hair softness 
Egg yolk contains 2654 g of fat per 100 g 
 A specific fat called lecithin that is in eggs could help to moisturize the hair 
This fat is also a constituent of some cosmetic hair products 
Alternative health experts often recommend using egg yolks for dry damaged hair for these reasons 
 There are several different suggestions for how to use egg yolks for helping the hair stay healthy 
 One example is making an egg hair mask as follows In addition to using just egg yolks on the hair some people suggest adding different ingredients into the egg yolk mixture to enhance shine and softness 
 Examples include As mentioned earlier there are few studies to support the use of these products in this way 
 Some natural beauty experts tout egg yolks for helping to keep hair moisturized and soft 
But there may also be benefits to applying egg whites to the hair 
 Egg whites are the more liquid portion of the egg that does not include the egg yolk 
 Egg whites are high in protein  as well as vitamins  such as niacin and riboflavin 
A kidney transplant may help them regain normal kidney function
