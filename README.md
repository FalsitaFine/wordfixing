# Wordfixing Model

Designed for fixing wrong words generated by speech recognition models(trained model focused on medical field).
This is an early version. May need tensorflow_gpu pre-installed.

For demo, try: python3 fixing.py "testbench"

The program will try to fix the wrong words in the file "mutated.txt" and compute the performance based on the correct result ("mutated_ref.txt").

Fixing result: see sample_out.png.

# Algorithms

Four different models are used in this demo:

N-gram model;
LSTM model;
(Bi-directional) N-gram model;
(Bi-directional) LSTM model;

Further design might combine these models via some vote algorithm.
