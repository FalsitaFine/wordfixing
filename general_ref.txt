 Although food contains all of the nutrients we need for good health ,COMMA they are locked up in large ,COMMA complex compounds .PERIOD So that they can be used by the body ,COMMA they must first be broken into smaller parts by the process of digestion .PERIOD In this article ,COMMA we explain how food is converted into the building blocks of life and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA poop .PERIOD In a nutshell ,COMMA digestion involves breaking down large food molecules into water-soluble molecules that can be passed into the blood and transported to the body's organs .PERIOD For instance ,COMMA carbohydrates are broken down into glucose ,COMMA proteins into amino acids ,COMMA and fats into fatty acids and glycerol .PERIOD The digestive system involves "hollow" organs and "solid" organs .PERIOD Food travels through the hollow organs — mouth ,COMMA esophagus ,COMMA stomach ,COMMA small intestine ,COMMA large intestine ,COMMA and anus .PERIOD The solid organs — pancreas ,COMMA liver ,COMMA and gallbladder — add various products into the mix .PERIOD Aside from the solid and hollow organs ,COMMA the nervous and circulatory systems are also important in digestion ,COMMA as are the bacteria that live in the gut .PERIOD Digestion is often broken down into two types: In humans ,COMMA the gastrointestinal tract (also called the alimentary canal) is around 8 meters long .PERIOD One writer describes it as "the most important and least lovely waterway on Earth .PERIOD" Below ,COMMA we describe the journey of a mouthful of food: Digestion begins even before the food enters the mouth .PERIOD The smell ,COMMA or even the thought of food ,COMMA starts the production of saliva by the salivary glands .PERIOD Once the food is inside the mouth ,COMMA it is moistened by saliva ,COMMA and the teeth and tongue begin the process of mechanical digestion .PERIOD Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase ,COMMA which breaks down starch .PERIOD Saliva also contains mucus that helps ease the passage of food through the digestive system .PERIOD Once chewing (mastication) and amylase digestion are complete ,COMMA the food will have become a small round blob ,COMMA which is known as a bolus .PERIOD After swallowing ,COMMA the bolus enters the esophagus and is moved down to the stomach through a process called peristalsis .PERIOD Peristalsis is the slow contraction of smooth muscles around the pipes of the digestive system .PERIOD Slow waves of contraction run along the gut ,COMMA pushing the bolus along in the right direction — away from the mouth and toward the anus .PERIOD The bolus enters the stomach through a muscular valve at the top called the cardiac sphincter .PERIOD This sphincter controls how much food enters the stomach and when .PERIOD The stomach contains gastric juice ,COMMA which contains mostly: Both of these chemicals could potentially harm the lining of the stomach ,COMMA so it produces a slimy layer to protect itself from damage .PERIOD In the stomach ,COMMA peristalsis continues ,COMMA which helps to mix the food with the gastric juices .PERIOD Not many compounds are absorbed into the blood from the stomach; exceptions to this include water ,COMMA alcohol ,COMMA and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) .PERIOD After 1–2 hours in the stomach ,COMMA the food is a thick paste ,COMMA referred to as chyme .PERIOD It leaves the stomach through the pyloric sphincter at the bottom of the stomach .PERIOD The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine .PERIOD Here ,COMMA the chyme mixes with enzymes from the pancreas ,COMMA bile from the liver ,COMMA and intestinal juice: Bile — produced by the liver ,COMMA it helps break down fats and is stored in the gallbladder .PERIOD Pancreatic juice — contains a cocktail of enzymes ,COMMA including trypsinogen ,COMMA elastase ,COMMA and amylase .PERIOD Intestinal juice — this fluid activates some of the enzymes in the pancreatic juice .PERIOD It also contains other enzymes ,COMMA mucus ,COMMA and hormones .PERIOD The food continues its journey through the remaining parts of the small intestine — the jejunum and ileum — being gradually digested as it goes .PERIOD Once it is fully broken down ,COMMA it is absorbed into the blood .PERIOD In humans ,COMMA the vast majority of nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine .PERIOD Tiny finger-like projections called villi stick out from the walls of the duodenum and increase its surface area .PERIOD Villi maximize the amount of nutrients that can be absorbed .PERIOD The surface area is further increased by microvilli ,COMMA which are even smaller projections that come from the cells of the intestine's epithelium (lining) .PERIOD Also called the colon and large bowel ,COMMA the large intestine is 1 .PERIOD5 meters (5 feet) in length .PERIOD Although it is shorter than the small intestine ,COMMA it is thicker in diameter .PERIOD In the large intestine ,COMMA water and minerals are absorbed into the blood .PERIOD Food travels through this region much slower to allow fermentation by gut bacteria .PERIOD The large intestine absorbs any products produced by bacterial activity ,COMMA such as vitamin K ,COMMA vitamin B12 ,COMMA thiamine ,COMMA and riboflavin .PERIOD The large intestine is split into sections: The ascending colon — this includes the cecum (a pouch that joins onto the ileum) and the appendix (another small pouch .PERIOD Its function is unclear ,COMMA but it may play a role in maintaining gut bacteria) .PERIOD The transverse colon — this section crosse the abdomen .PERIOD The descending colon – this section has a dense population of gut bacteria and is used to store feces .PERIOD The sigmoid (S-shaped) colon – has muscular walls that help push feces into the rectum .PERIOD Any waste left over that the body cannot use is moved to the rectum and excreted through the anus during defecation .PERIOD This may occur multiple times in a single day ,COMMA or once every few days .PERIOD Stretch receptors in the wall of the rectum detect when the chamber is full and stimulate the desire to defecate .PERIOD If defecation is delayed ,COMMA the feces can be moved back into the colon where water is absorbed back into the body .PERIOD If defecation is postponed for an extended period ,COMMA more water is removed ,COMMA the stool becomes hard ,COMMA and the individual may become constipated .PERIOD Different components of the diet are broken down in various ways: Protein — digested by three enzymes called pepsin (in the stomach) ,COMMA trypsin ,COMMA and chymotrypsin (in the duodenum ,COMMA secreted by the pancreas) .PERIOD Fat — lingual lipase begins fat digestion in the mouth .PERIOD However ,COMMA most fat is broken down in the small intestine by pancreatic lipase .PERIOD Bile also helps in the process of breaking down fats .PERIOD Carbohydrate — salivary and pancreatic amylase break down starches into individual glucose units .PERIOD Lactase breaks down lactose ,COMMA the sugar in milk .PERIOD Sucrase breaks down sucrose (table sugar or cane sugar) .PERIOD DNA and RNA — broken down by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and ribonuclease (RNase) produced by the pancreas .PERIOD Certain essential ,COMMA complex molecules would be ruined if they mixed with digestive juices in the stomach .PERIOD For instance ,COMMA vitamin B12 is very sensitive to acid and ,COMMA if it was broken down into its parts ,COMMA it could not fulfill its role in the body .PERIOD In these cases ,COMMA non-destructive digestion takes place .PERIOD For vitamin B12 ,COMMA a chemical in saliva called haptocorrin binds to and protects the molecule .PERIOD In the duodenum ,COMMA the bond is split ,COMMA and B12 attaches to intrinsic factor .PERIOD Then ,COMMA once in the ileum ,COMMA special receptors carry the two bound molecules into the blood .PERIOD Digestion is a complex process that requires different organs to make moves at the right time .PERIOD For instance ,COMMA the right enzymes need to be squirted into the right place at the right time and in the right amounts .PERIOD To help organize this system ,COMMA a range of hormones are involved ,COMMA these include: Gastrin — released in the stomach ,COMMA this hormone stimulates the production of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen (an inactive form of pepsin) .PERIOD Gastrin is produced in response to the arrival of food in the stomach .PERIOD Acidic pH levels reduce the levels of gastrin .PERIOD Secretin — stimulates bicarbonate secretion to neutralize acid in the duodenum .PERIOD Cholecystokinin (CCK) — also found in the duodenum ,COMMA this hormone stimulates the pancreas to release enzymes and the gallbladder to release bile .PERIOD Gastric inhibitory peptide — decreases the churning of the stomach and reduces the speed that food empties from the stomach .PERIOD It also triggers the secretion of insulin .PERIOD Motilin — stimulates the production of pepsin and speeds up peristalsis .PERIOD Depending on the individual and the type of food they have eaten ,COMMA digestion — from mouth to bathroom — takes 24–72 hours .PERIOD Poop or feces is the remains of food that could not be absorbed by the small intestine that has been rotted down by bacteria in the large intestine .PERIOD It contains bacteria ,COMMA and some small amounts of metabolic waste products ,COMMA such as bile and bilirubin (from the breakdown of blood) .PERIOD Feces can vary in color widely (read more about what the various stool colors mean here ) and can be different consistencies ,COMMA from watery to solid .PERIOD Digestion is as complex as it is important .PERIOD To transfer food into useful components involves multiple organs and systems ,COMMA a range of chemicals ,COMMA and impressive coordination .PERIOD The road from burger to poop is a long and winding one .PERIOD Article last updated by Tim Newman on Thu 11 January 2018 .PERIOD Visit our GastroIntestinal

 The new study was carried out by researchers at the Universities of Exeter and Brighton ,COMMA both of which are located in the United Kingdom .PERIOD Lorna Harries ,COMMA a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter ,COMMA led the researchers ,COMMA and the first author of the paper is Dr .PERIOD Eva Latorre ,COMMA a research associate at the same institution .PERIOD The new study builds on previous research from the University of Exeter ,COMMA which found that so-called splicing factors — which are a type of protein — tend to become inactive as we age .PERIOD In the new study ,COMMA the researchers added "resveralogues ,COMMA" or chemicals similar to resveratrol ,COMMA to aging human cells and found that they reactivated these splicing factors .PERIOD This ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA not only made the old cells appear younger ,COMMA but they also started dividing again ,COMMA as young cells would .PERIOD "When I saw some of the cells in the culture dish rejuvenating I couldn't believe it ,COMMA" says Dr .PERIOD Latorre .PERIOD "These old cells were looking like young cells .PERIOD It was like magic ,COMMA" she says .PERIOD "I repeated the experiments several times and in each case ,COMMA the cells rejuvenated .PERIOD I am very excited by the implications and potential for this research ,COMMA" Dr .PERIOD Latorre adds .PERIOD Resveratrol is a compound found in peanuts ,COMMA grapes ,COMMA red wine ,COMMA dark chocolate ,COMMA and some berries .PERIOD For us to better understand the context of the new findings ,COMMA Prof .PERIOD Harries explained to Medical News Today what mRNA splicing is .PERIOD "The information in our genes is carried our DNA ,COMMA" she said .PERIOD "Every cell in the body carries the same genes ,COMMA but not every gene is switched on in every cell .PERIOD That's one of the things that makes a kidney cell a kidney cell and heart cell a heart cell .PERIOD" "When a gene is needed ,COMMA" she continued ,COMMA "it is switched on and an initial message called an RNA ,COMMA that contains the instructions for whatever the gene makes .PERIOD The interesting thing is that most genes can make more than one message .PERIOD" "The initial message is made up of building blocks that can be kept in or left out to make different messages ,COMMA" Prof .PERIOD Harries added .PERIOD inclusion or removal of the building blocks is done by a process called mRNA splicing ,COMMA whereby the different blocks are joined together as necessary .PERIOD" "It's a bit like a recipe book ,COMMA where you can make either a vanilla sponge or a chocolate cake ,COMMA depending on whether or not you add chocolate!" she said .PERIOD " We have previously found that the proteins that make the decision as to whether a block is left in our taken out (these are called splicing factors) are the ones that change most as we age .PERIOD" Prof .PERIOD Lorna Harries findings demonstrate] that when you treat old cells with molecules that restore the levels of the splicing factors ,COMMA the cells regain some features of youth ,COMMA" explains Prof .PERIOD Harries .PERIOD "They are able to grow ,COMMA and their telomeres — the caps on the ends of the chromosomes that shorten as we age — are now longer ,COMMA as they are in young cells .PERIOD" were quite surprised by the magnitude of findings] ,COMMA" Prof .PERIOD Harries told MNT .PERIOD She also said that the rejuvenating effects lasted for weeks ,COMMA which was also very exciting .PERIOD The discovery may soon improve the healthspan of seniors .PERIOD "This is a first step in trying to make people live normal lifespans ,COMMA but with health for their entire life ,COMMA" explains Prof .PERIOD Harries .PERIOD On the same note ,COMMA study co-author Prof .PERIOD Richard Faragher ,COMMA of the University of Brighton ,COMMA says: " At a time when our capacity to translate new knowledge about the mechanisms of aging into medicines and lifestyle advice is limited only by a chronic shortage of funds ,COMMA older people are ill-served by self-indulgent science fiction .PERIOD They need practical action to restore their health and they need it yesterday .PERIOD" Prof .PERIOD Harries also shared with us some of the researchers' plans for their future investigations ,COMMA saying ,COMMA "We are now trying to see if we can find out how the changes in splicing factor levels cell rescue .PERIOD We have more papers in preparation on this so watch this space!" 
 The study  — which was recently published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering  — reveals how altering the structure of chromatin in cancer cells could make them easier to destroy .PERIOD In the cell nucleus ,COMMA DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones .PERIOD Together they form chromatin .PERIOD Chromatin's job is to package the genetic code neatly into the cell's nucleus .PERIOD Chromatin can also regulate which genes are switched on and off .PERIOD In cancer cells ,COMMA however ,COMMA chromatin helps them to evolve and adapt to cancer therapies ,COMMA thereby allowing them to survive .PERIOD "If you think of genetics as hardware ,COMMA" explains study co-author Vadim Backman ,COMMA of the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University in Evanston ,COMMA IL ,COMMA "then chromatin is the software .PERIOD" "Complex diseases such as cancer ,COMMA" he adds ,COMMA "do not depend on the behavior of individual genes ,COMMA but on the complex interplay among tens of thousands of genes .PERIOD" So ,COMMA Backman and his colleagues set their sights on chromatin as the key to combating cancer drug resistance ,COMMA and an imaging technique they developed last year helped them to learn more about this intricate set of macromolecules .PERIOD The new technique is called Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy ,COMMA and it enables real-time monitoring of chromatin in living cells .PERIOD Additionally ,COMMA the researchers explain that PWS allows them to assess chromatin at a length scale of 20–200 nanometers ,COMMA which they say is the precise point at which cancer formation influences chromatin .PERIOD They used PWS to monitor chromatin in cultured cancer cells .PERIOD They found that chromatin has a specific "packing density" associated with gene expression that helps cancer cells to evade treatments .PERIOD The analysis revealed that a more heterogeneous and disordered chromatin packing density was related to greater cancer cell survival in response to chemotherapy .PERIOD A more conservative and ordered packing density ,COMMA however ,COMMA was linked to greater cancer cell death in response to chemotherapy .PERIOD "Just by looking at the cell's chromatin structure ,COMMA we could predict whether or not it would survive ,COMMA" says Backman .PERIOD "Cells with normal chromatin structures die because they can't respond; they can't explore their genome in search of resistance .PERIOD They can't develop resistance .PERIOD" Based on their discovery ,COMMA the researchers hypothesized that altering the structure of chromatin to make it more orderly could be one way of boosting cancer cells' vulnerability to treatment .PERIOD On further investigation ,COMMA the team found that they could modify chromatin's structure by altering electrolytes in the nucleus of cancer cells .PERIOD The team tested this strategy using two drugs that are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Celecoxib and Digoxin .PERIOD Celecoxib is currently used for pain relief ,COMMA while Digoxin is used to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure .PERIOD Both drugs ,COMMA however ,COMMA are also able to change the packing density of chromatin .PERIOD The researchers combined these drugs — which they refer to as chromatin protection therapeutics (CPTs) — with chemotherapy and tested them on cancer cells in the laboratory .PERIOD According to Backman ,COMMA they witnessed "something remarkable .PERIOD" " Within 2 or 3 days ,COMMA nearly every single cancer cell died because they could not respond .PERIOD The CPT compounds don't kill the cells; they restructure the chromatin .PERIOD If you block the cells' ability to evolve and to adapt ,COMMA that's their Achilles' heel .PERIOD" Vadim Backman While the researchers are excited by their findings ,COMMA they caution that animal and human studies are needed before any firm conclusions can be made .PERIOD "There is a big difference between cell cultures and humans ,COMMA" says Backman .PERIOD "You never know how the environment inside the human body will affect cancer's behavior or if there will be unforeseen side effects .PERIOD" That said ,COMMA the researchers note that they have replicated their findings in seven different cancer types so far ,COMMA which Backman says is "very promising .PERIOD" 
 If you think I'm being dramatic ,COMMA you're probably among the 70 percent of Americans who don't realize that alcohol consumption is a significant risk factor for cancer .PERIOD As a writer for a medical news website ,COMMA I'm well aware that drinking can increase cancer risk .PERIOD I'm also aware of the studies  suggesting that moderate alcohol consumption has health benefits .PERIOD It's highly likely that I subconsciously use the latter as an excuse for my occasional glass of wine: "It's good for me ,COMMA so why not ?QUESTION!" But ,COMMA as a new statement from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) — which was recently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology  — reveals ,COMMA even light drinking could be putting my health at risk .PERIOD "Alcohol ,COMMA" write the study authors ,COMMA "is causally associated with oropharyngeal and larynx cancer ,COMMA esophageal cancer ,COMMA hepatocellular carcinoma ,COMMA breast cancer ,COMMA and colon cancer .PERIOD Even modest use of alcohol may increase cancer risk ,COMMA but the greatest risks are observed with heavy ,COMMA long-term use .PERIOD" ASCO's conclusions come from a review of more than 150 studies looking at the link between alcohol and cancer .PERIOD What is more ,COMMA the authors report that around 5 .PERIOD5 percent of new cancer cases and around 5 .PERIOD8 percent of cancer deaths worldwide are directly related to alcohol intake .PERIOD Only 38 percent of people in the United States are actively cutting back on their alcohol intake as a way of reducing cancer risk .PERIOD "People typically don't associate drinking beer ,COMMA wine ,COMMA and hard liquor with increasing their risk of developing cancer in their lifetimes ,COMMA" notes Dr .PERIOD Bruce Johnson ,COMMA president of ASCO .PERIOD But maybe it's time that we did .PERIOD .PERIOD .PERIOD .PERIOD] limiting alcohol intake is a means to prevent cancer ,COMMA" adds lead statement author Dr .PERIOD Noelle K .PERIOD LoConte ,COMMA an associate professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin in Madison .PERIOD " The good news is that ,COMMA just like people wear sunscreen to limit their risk of skin cancer ,COMMA limiting alcohol intake is one more thing people can do to reduce their overall risk of developing cancer .PERIOD" Dr .PERIOD Noelle K .PERIOD LoConte As part of the statement ,COMMA ASCO put forward some recommendations that they believe could help to reduce alcohol intake in the U .PERIODS .PERIOD These include increasing the price of alcohol ,COMMA raising alcohol tax ,COMMA introducing stricter regulations on the sale of alcohol to minors ,COMMA and incorporating alcohol control strategies in cancer prevention plans .PERIOD The statement also highlights the importance of oncologists in informing us about the cancer risks associated with alcohol intake .PERIOD "Oncology providers ,COMMA" write the authors ,COMMA "can serve as community advisors and leaders and can help raise the awareness of alcohol as a cancer risk behavior .PERIOD" Yes ,COMMA ASCO's recommendations could help to reduce alcohol consumption across America ,COMMA but I am a firm believer that cutting back on the booze starts with oneself .PERIOD Earlier this year ,COMMA I took part in Dry January ,COMMA a public health campaign designed to encourage people to abstain from alcohol for 1 month .PERIOD I was sure that denying myself that glass of pinot would be challenging ,COMMA but I was surprised at how little I missed it .PERIOD That said ,COMMA my abstinence from alcohol did not last beyond 1 month ,COMMA and I suspect that this was the case for many others who participated in Dry January .PERIOD I was reintroduced to Mr .PERIOD Pinot at a friend's birthday party in February ,COMMA and it was then that I tagged myself as a "social drinker .PERIOD" By definition ,COMMA a social drinker is a person who predominantly consumes alcohol in a social setting ,COMMA but not to excess levels .PERIOD If I'm honest ,COMMA I can't see myself abstaining from alcohol long-term; I enjoy a drink with my friends .PERIOD However ,COMMA given that even modest alcohol intake has been linked to cancer and other health problems ,COMMA maybe we could all benefit from cutting back on the drink .PERIOD Cancer is one of America's biggest health burdens .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA just last year ,COMMA more than 1 .PERIOD6 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in the U .PERIODS .PERIOD ,COMMA and more than 595 ,COMMA000 people died from the disease .PERIOD I don't want to add to these statistics .PERIOD So ,COMMA the next time I'm out with friends and debating that extra drink ,COMMA I'll be asking myself ,COMMA "Is that glass of wine really worth risking my health ?QUESTION" If you're looking to limit your alcohol intake ,COMMA the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism provide some useful tips .PERIOD 
 Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart unexpectedly stops beating ,COMMA due to faulty electrical signaling that affects heart rate .PERIOD Sudden cardiac arrest is ,COMMA more often than not ,COMMA fatal ,COMMA and it requires immediate specialized attention in order for the worst outcome to be prevented .PERIOD According to the latest data available to the American Heart Association (AHA) ,COMMA in 2016 ,COMMA more than 350 ,COMMA000 people experienced a cardiac arrest outside of hospital ,COMMA and ,COMMA of these ,COMMA only 12 percent survived .PERIOD The main factors that influence susceptibility to cardiac arrest include age ,COMMA biological sex ,COMMA race ,COMMA and existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions .PERIOD Therefore ,COMMA the National Heart ,COMMA Lung ,COMMA and Blood Institute say that older men ,COMMA black people ,COMMA and individuals with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or diabetes are most at risk .PERIOD Because of the poor outcome of cardiac arrest ,COMMA many who consider themselves at risk may try to avoid certain activities ,COMMA such as sex ,COMMA believing that they render them more exposed .PERIOD But new research on which a number of prestigious institutions — including Helsinki University Hospital in Finland and the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles ,COMMA CA — collaborated has revealed that it is unlikely that cardiac arrest will occur during sexual intercourse .PERIOD The findings of the study ,COMMA whose first author was Dr .PERIOD Aapo Aro — from Helsinki University Hospital — were presented yesterday at the AHA's Scientific Sessions 2017 ,COMMA held in Anaheim ,COMMA CA .PERIOD The researchers reviewed the medical records of adults from a Northwestern community in the United States between 2002 and 2015 .PERIOD In a population of around 1 million individuals ,COMMA the team identified 4 ,COMMA557 cases of cardiac arrest .PERIOD For a case of cardiac arrest to be considered related to sexual activity ,COMMA however ,COMMA it was required to have occurred either "during or within 1 hour of sexual intercourse .PERIOD" Of all the instances of cardiac arrest that the researchers identified ,COMMA only 34 (0 .PERIOD7 percent) were considered "related to sexual activity ,COMMA" with 18 cases having occurred during sex and 15 cases immediately after .PERIOD Dr .PERIOD Aro and team also noted that the annual incidence of sex-related cardiac arrest (SEX-SCA) was only 0 .PERIOD28 per 100 ,COMMA000 cases .PERIOD In all ,COMMA men were likelier to experience cardiac arrest due to sexual activity: 1 percent of all cases among male adults were related to intercourse .PERIOD For women ,COMMA only 0 .PERIOD1 percent of cardiac arrest events were due to sex .PERIOD Perhaps even more surprisingly ,COMMA people who experienced SEX-SCA were typically younger than expected ,COMMA at approximately 60 years .PERIOD Also ,COMMA African Americans were more exposed than other groups ,COMMA accounting for 19 percent of SEX-SCA cases .PERIOD There were no significant differences in terms of cardiac disease history and medication across groups ,COMMA although ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia were more common than other heart conditions .PERIOD Individuals who had cardiac arrest during or straight after sex only received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from their partner in a third of all cases ,COMMA despite the fact that it can be life-saving .PERIOD Looking at the numbers ,COMMA the researchers concluded that the overall risk of cardiac arrest being triggered by sexual activity was low ,COMMA and even lower for women .PERIOD Still ,COMMA while these results are reassuring ,COMMA Dr .PERIOD Aro and colleagues highlight the necessity of educating the general population about the importance of CPR ,COMMA as well as knowing how to perform this procedure correctly .PERIOD 
 So far ,COMMA research into the potency of chamomile tea has shown promise .PERIOD However ,COMMA studies vary with some research proving clear benefits compared to alternative remedies ,COMMA and others merely pointing to possible ones .PERIOD For most people ,COMMA chamomile tea is safe to try as a supplement to other treatments ,COMMA but it should not replace mainstream medical treatments when people have serious illnesses .PERIOD The potency of various chamomile teas varies ,COMMA with some containing significantly more chamomile than others .PERIOD The more potent teas are also more likely to cause side effects in people who are vulnerable to them .PERIOD Consequently ,COMMA it is safest to start with a low dosage and work up to larger doses slowly .PERIOD Chamomile contains chemicals called flavonoids .PERIOD These flavonoids are a type of nutrient present in many plants ,COMMA and they play a significant role in chamomile's medicinal effects .PERIOD Researchers are not

include: Several studies have linked chamomile tea to reduced severity of menstrual cramps .PERIOD A 2010 study ,COMMA for example ,COMMA found that consuming chamomile tea for a month could reduce the pain of menstrual cramps .PERIOD Women in the study also reported less anxiety and distress associated with period pain .PERIOD Again ,COMMA some studies have found that chamomile tea can lower blood sugar in people with diabetes .PERIOD Research does not show that chamomile is a viable substitute for diabetes medications ,COMMA but it may be a helpful supplement to existing treatments .PERIOD Similarly ,COMMA a 2008 study of rats found that consistent consumption of chamomile tea might prevent blood sugar from increasing .PERIOD This effect reduces the long-term risk of diabetes complications ,COMMA suggesting that chamomile could improve diabetes outcomes .PERIOD Osteoporosis is the progressive loss of bone density .PERIOD This loss increases the risk of broken bones and stooped posture .PERIOD While anyone can develop osteoporosis ,COMMA it is most common among post-menopausal women .PERIOD This tendency may be due to the effects of estrogen .PERIOD A 2004 study

 Kidney stones are solid clumps of material that develop in the kidney .PERIOD They consist of crystal-forming substances ,COMMA such as calcium ,COMMA oxalate ,COMMA and uric acid .PERIOD They have been part of the human experience for thousands of years; a treatment for kidney stones is mentioned in an Egyptian medical text from 1500 BC .PERIOD In modern-day America ,COMMA an estimated 12 percent of the population will experience one or more of these uninvited guests at some point in their lives .PERIOD Small stones can exit the body during urination with little or no fanfare .PERIOD Larger stones ,COMMA however ,COMMA are a different story; although rarely fatal ,COMMA they can be excruciating .PERIOD To give you some idea ,COMMA the following comes from a first-hand account .PERIOD "It was what I can imagine a knife stuck in my back being twisted all around would feel like .PERIOD" According to another ,COMMA "A female nurse told me it's the worst pain a man can ever feel because a man can't go through labor .PERIOD" Aside from the agony ,COMMA kidney stones don't come cheap ,COMMA either .PERIOD In 2000 ,COMMA around $2 .PERIOD1 billion was spent treating them in U .PERIODS .PERIOD hospitals .PERIOD This figure marked a 50 percent increase since 1994 .PERIOD Due to the cost ,COMMA the steady increase of prevalence ,COMMA and the intense pain ,COMMA there is significant interest in understanding why these ghastly miniature boulders are formed .PERIOD Certain risk factors are well-established .PERIOD For instance ,COMMA if you are male or have diabetes ,COMMA you are more likely to develop them .PERIOD Another factor that raises your chance of growing your very own kidney stone is your ZIP code .PERIOD A landmark study published in 1994 looked at data from more than 1 million men and women across the U .PERIODS .PERIOD They established the so-called stone belt .PERIOD Their analysis uncovered a distinct geographic pattern of kidney stones .PERIOD As they rolled further south and east ,COMMA prevalence increased .PERIOD Men in North Carolina ,COMMA for example ,COMMA had an almost three times greater risk of developing kidney stones than men in North Dakota .PERIOD At first glance ,COMMA this map-based lottery seems strange and perhaps a little unfair .PERIOD However ,COMMA it makes more sense when the weather is taken into account .PERIOD People living in hotter climes are likely to sweat more ,COMMA so it follows that they are also more likely to be dehydrated .PERIOD And ,COMMA being chronically dehydrated is a well-established risk factor for kidney stones .PERIOD But according to the authors of the latest study ,COMMA temperature cannot be the only vagabond on the rocky road to internal stones .PERIOD As they explain: " temperature does not fully account for the stone belt phenomenon .PERIOD If temperature alone was the primary environmental driving factor ,COMMA the American Southwest should have a similar stone prevalence to the Southeast .PERIOD" .PERIOD .PERIOD .PERIODAnd it doesn't ,COMMA so researchers from Stanford University School of Medicine in California set out to investigate another climate-based factor: precipitation .PERIOD The results were recently published in the Journal of Endourology .PERIOD To test their theory ,COMMA the researchers concentrated on the good folk of California ,COMMA which is a state with a particularly varied climate .PERIOD They dived into data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development databases .PERIOD They perused the facts and figures of 63 ,COMMA994 people who underwent kidney stone procedures in the state in 2010–2012 .PERIOD They also gathered climate information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .PERIOD Each participant's ZIP code was available ,COMMA allowing the team to pinpoint their location and identify what sort of weather they were likely to experience .PERIOD Once the numbers had been crunched ,COMMA their hunch turned out to be spot on .PERIOD Although the effect was relatively small ,COMMA it remained significant even after controlling for factors such as sex ,COMMA age ,COMMA and the prevalence of obesity and diabetes .PERIOD They found that for every additional inch of rain ,COMMA there were an extra 0 .PERIOD019 surgeries per 1 ,COMMA000 people .PERIOD Likewise ,COMMA each degree Fahrenheit increase in mean temperature caused an additional 0 .PERIOD029 surgeries per 1 ,COMMA000 people .PERIOD The study authors believe that a warm and precipitous environment ,COMMA compared with a warm and dry environment ,COMMA gives rise to more kidney stones because the body's thermoregulation system handles it less well .PERIOD When it is humid ,COMMA sweat cannot evaporate as easily ,COMMA meaning that the body's primary defense against heat is toothless .PERIOD So ,COMMA more sweat is produced in a fruitless attempt to keep us cool .PERIOD Though at this stage ,COMMA more work will be needed to get a proper picture of what's going on .PERIOD As a worrying aside ,COMMA the study authors bring up the potential impact of global warming .PERIOD With both average temperature and precipitation predicted to increase across the planet ,COMMA kidney stone prevalence is also likely to increase — yet another reason to buy an electric car .PERIOD So ,COMMA if you live somewhere both hot and wet ,COMMA you are slightly more likely to develop kidney stones .PERIOD This may be an unsettling thought ,COMMA so you could always move to the Antarctic: the coldest ,COMMA driest place on earth .PERIOD Or ,COMMA if that doesn't float your boat ,COMMA just make sure you drink enough fluids .PERIOD 
 This was the main finding of a large study — by researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston ,COMMA MA — that measured physical activity in older women as they wore sensitive activity trackers and then followed them for up to 4 years .PERIOD "Physical inactivity is estimated to cause as many deaths globally each year as smoking ,COMMA" note the researchers in a report on the study that was published recently in the journal Circulation .PERIOD In the United States ,COMMA the current federal guidelines for improving health through physical activity recommend that per week ,COMMA adults should undertake 150 minutes of "moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity ,COMMA" 75 minutes of "vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity ,COMMA" or an "equivalent combination" of the two .PERIOD The federal guidelines give brisk walking and tennis as examples of moderate-intensity activity ,COMMA and jogging and swimming as examples of vigorous-intensity activity .PERIOD In addition ,COMMA they advise that the recommended aerobic activity should be accompanied by muscle-strengthening exercises ,COMMA such as with weights or resistance bands ,COMMA at least twice per week .PERIOD The study found that there was a strong relationship between the amount of exercise recorded on the women's activity trackers and a lower risk of death from all causes during the follow-up period .PERIOD The researchers explain that although evidence of such a relationship is not new ,COMMA the size of the risk reduction that they found is much greater than that reported in the wealth of older research that led to the guidelines' publication .PERIOD They found that the most active 25 percent of the women had a 60–70 percent lower risk of dying over the follow-up period than the least active 25 percent .PERIOD The new study is one of the first to use data from a new generation of wearable devices known as "triaxial accelerometers" and relate the measurements to a clinical outcome — which ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA was death from all causes .PERIOD In previous studies that have examined the same relationship ,COMMA the activity data were gleaned from participants' own self-reports or less sophisticated "uniaxial devices .PERIOD" Analyses based on these have estimated a much smaller risk reduction of 20–30 percent .PERIOD "The fact the physical activity lowers mortality rate is nothing new ,COMMA" says first study author Dr .PERIOD I-Min Lee ,COMMA adding that "we have many studies showing this .PERIOD However ,COMMA previous studies have primarily relied on self-reported physical activity ,COMMA and self-reports tend to be imprecise .PERIOD" The more advanced devices used in the new study are better at recognizing physical activity and can measure it more precisely .PERIOD For example ,COMMA they can differentiate low levels of physical activity — such as slow walking — from just sitting or sedentary behavior ,COMMA which scientists have become more interested in lately .PERIOD The team notes that the finding of a 60–70 percent reduction in risk puts the effect of physical activity on a par with that of not smoking; non-smokers have a 50 percent lower risk of early death compared with those who do smoke .PERIOD For the new study ,COMMA the researchers analyzed records from tens of thousands of women taking part in the Women's Health Study .PERIOD The analysis only included women who had worn the triaxial accelerometers that had been mailed to them for a minimum of 10 hours per day on at least 4 days out of the 7 designated to them .PERIOD The total number of participants included was 16 ,COMMA741 ,COMMA and their average age was 72 years .PERIOD The authors note that 207 of the women died over an average follow-up period of 2 .PERIOD3 years .PERIOD The deaths were confirmed using death certificates ,COMMA medical records ,COMMA and the National Death Index .PERIOD As well as finding a 60–70 percent lower risk of death in the most active women ,COMMA the researchers found no link between reduced risk of death and light-intensity physical activity — such as slow walking or window shopping in malls — or sedentary behavior .PERIOD However ,COMMA they point out that this does not mean that light-intensity physical activity has no value; it may well benefit other areas of health that they did not measure in this study .PERIOD The researchers decided to study older women because there are gaps in the evidence relating to this group .PERIOD Dr .PERIOD Lee says ,COMMA "Younger people in their 20s and 30s generally can participate in vigorous-intensity activities ,COMMA such as running or playing basketbal .PERIOD" However ,COMMA older people might find it difficult ,COMMA if not impossible ,COMMA to exercise at a vigorous- or even a moderate-intensity level .PERIOD So ,COMMA the team wanted to see whether there were any benefits from light-intensity physical activities that older people are more likely to engage in .PERIOD The researchers note that the participants that they studied were mainly white women in good health ,COMMA and that their findings may not apply to other groups in the general population .PERIOD In the meantime ,COMMA they are continuing with the study in order to compare physical activity measures with other health outcomes .PERIOD They also wish to estimate the effects of the amount and types of exercise on health .PERIOD " This study supports current guidelines for physical activity ,COMMA such as those from the federal government and the American Heart Association ,COMMA that emphasize moderate-intensity physical activity .PERIOD It also adds to existing evidence that can inform upcoming physical activity guidelines over time .PERIOD" Dr .PERIOD I-Min Lee

 So concludes a review of sleep research by Kenneth Lichstein ,COMMA a professor of psychology from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa ,COMMA who recently reported his findings in the journal of Behaviour Research and Therapy .PERIOD Insomnia is a common disorder in which people find it hard to fall asleep ,COMMA stay asleep ,COMMA or both .PERIOD This can cause them to have insufficient or poor-quality sleep that leaves them feeling unrefreshed at the start of their day .PERIOD But the new findings support the idea that insomnia may also have a psychological component .PERIOD  Prof .PERIOD Lichstein ,COMMA who has been researching sleep for more than 30 years ,COMMA revealed that believing oneself to suffer from poor sleep — which he defines as having "insomnia identity" — is a better predictor of poor health than the sleep that is actually measured .PERIOD "We can independently assess people's view of their sleep and their sleep ,COMMA" he explains ,COMMA adding that identity is a more potent predictor of daytime impairment than poor sleep .PERIOD" Prof .PERIOD Lichstein is not arguing with the fact that insufficient sleep — which is thought to affect around a third of adults in the United States — is linked to prolonged illnesses such as heart disease ,COMMA diabetes ,COMMA and depression .PERIOD  What he concluded ,COMMA after reviewing 12 sleep studies that have been published during the past 20 years ,COMMA is that regardless of whether one actually has poor sleep or not ,COMMA believing oneself to be an insomniac can do just as much ,COMMA if not more ,COMMA harm .PERIOD Individuals with insomnia identity become anxious about not getting what they perceive be a good sleep .PERIOD Perhaps they take longer to fall asleep than they wish ,COMMA or they wake briefly during a sleep ,COMMA and they see these problems as being major causes of sleep deprivation when their impact is actually quite minor .PERIOD "Insomnia identity drives worry ,COMMA" Prof .PERIOD Lichstein says ,COMMA "and worry is the fuel of stress .PERIOD That stress has physical effects on our life .PERIOD" In his review ,COMMA he compared the "presence or absence of poor sleep" — which can be measured — with the "presence or absence of insomnia identity" and found patterns that run counter to "conventional wisdom .PERIOD"  Regardless of whether or not poor sleep was actually present ,COMMA individuals who labeled themselves as insomniacs — that is ,COMMA "claimed an insomnia identity" — were at greater risk of conditions that are associated with poor sleep ,COMMA such as depression ,COMMA self-stigma ,COMMA suicidal thoughts ,COMMA anxiety ,COMMA fatigue ,COMMA and high blood pressure .PERIOD Prof .PERIOD Lichstein suggests that around a third of people who believe themselves to be insomniacs actually sleep well .PERIOD He also proposes that around 25 percent of people are what he terms "uncoupled sleepers" — that is ,COMMA they have an "uncoupling ,COMMA" or disconnect ,COMMA between their actual sleep and how they appraise sleep .PERIOD  This gives rise ,COMMA Prof .PERIOD Lichstein explains ,COMMA to "complaining good sleepers" and "noncomplaining poor sleepers ,COMMA" and that "daytime impairment accrues more strongly to those who endorse an insomnia identity .PERIOD" Noncomplaining poor sleepers seemed to be in better health ,COMMA according to self-reported outcomes ,COMMA than individuals with insomnia identity ,COMMA he found .PERIOD "There are clearly people with poor sleep who are relaxed about it ,COMMA" Prof .PERIOD Lichstein says .PERIOD They just let it "roll off their back ,COMMA and they are at low risk for impaired functioning .PERIOD" "Insomnia identity drives the daytime dysfunction ,COMMA not the sleep ,COMMA" he adds ,COMMA and he argues that research supports the idea that "there is a cost to pathologizing sleep .PERIOD"  The review concludes with suggestions for future research and theories on insomnia identity ,COMMA as well as how it might be treated and managed .PERIOD  " It's helpful to reconceptualize our view of insomnia in such a way that focuses on the critical clinical aspects of the disorder .PERIOD" Prof .PERIOD Kenneth Lichstein

 Cervicalgia is not usually a serious condition ,COMMA but it can cause discomfort and should be addressed directly .PERIOD This article will discuss what cervicalgia is and how it can be treated and prevented .PERIOD The neck ,COMMA also known as the cervical spine ,COMMA is tasked with both protecting the spinal cord and supporting the head while allowing for a good range of movement .PERIOD It is made up of bones ,COMMA nerves ,COMMA muscles ,COMMA ligaments ,COMMA and tendons that are structured to allow the neck to be protective while remaining flexible .PERIOD This capacity to be flexible also makes the neck structure vulnerable to damage ,COMMA particularly given that it is constantly under pressure from keeping the head upright .PERIOD Some movements put either gradual or a sudden ,COMMA sharp pressure on the neck ,COMMA and the resulting strain can cause discomfort .PERIOD The injury is called cervicalgia when it only occurs in the neck region and not in other areas ,COMMA such as in the arms or lower back .PERIOD Cervicalgia can have many different causes .PERIOD Some of the most common include: Certain sports can cause kyphosis ,COMMA a condition affecting posture in a way that strains the neck .PERIOD Kyphosis can also lead to cervicalgia .PERIOD The shoulders can be pushed forward and become rounded ,COMMA putting pressure on the neck .PERIOD This pressure can occur from sports that promote this posture ,COMMA such as cycling ,COMMA or certain bodybuilding programs that build up chest muscles more than the back muscles .PERIOD Cervicalgia is marked by a pain in the neck region ,COMMA which can either be a sharp ,COMMA stabbing pain or a dull ,COMMA persistent pain .PERIOD The severity of the pain will vary depending on the extent of the injury ,COMMA and most cases of cervicalgia only cause mild discomfort .PERIOD Other symptoms of cervicalgia can include: The management of cervicalgia will vary depending on the cause .PERIOD In the majority of cases ,COMMA it can be treated at home .PERIOD Cervicalgia will typically go away within a couple of weeks .PERIOD People should see a doctor if the pain lasts for longer than a few weeks ,COMMA or immediately if the pain occurred as a direct result of an injury .PERIOD It is important to avoid any activities that may be causing a neck strain ,COMMA such as cycling ,COMMA and to rest the neck as much as possible .PERIOD If the injury has occurred from poor posture ,COMMA it is important to address this immediately and improve the posture .PERIOD Different approaches can be taken to treat cervicalgia at home: In some cases ,COMMA more serious treatment will be necessary ,COMMA including a physical therapy program or even surgery to reduce discomfort .PERIOD It is also possible for cervicalgia to be a sign of a more concerning condition ,COMMA such as a spinal infection .PERIOD Medical attention must be sought immediately if other symptoms develop ,COMMA such as feelings of numbness or shooting pains in the arms .PERIOD These symptoms may signal a bigger problem that needs urgent intervention .PERIOD While cervicalgia is a common problem ,COMMA it is possible to lower the risk of it occurring through some simple lifestyle changes .PERIOD Improving posture throughout the day Maintaining a good posture when seated or standing is an effective method of preventing cervicalgia .PERIOD Good posture provides support to the neck .PERIOD For example ,COMMA when working at a desk ,COMMA good posture can be maintained through keeping the knees bent at 90-degree angle ,COMMA with both feet flat on the floor and the neck in a neutral position .PERIOD Improving posture throughout the night The body is inactive for a long time when someone is sleeping ,COMMA so it is beneficial to maintain a good posture during sleep .PERIOD People should avoid sleeping on the stomach or in a position whereby the neck is twisted or bent .PERIOD It can help to use a supportive pillow that keeps the neck straight ,COMMA or keeping a pillow between the legs if sleeping on the side .PERIOD Stress management Engaging in stress reduction techniques ,COMMA such as meditation or physical exercise ,COMMA can reduce the strain placed on the shoulders and neck ,COMMA which often occurs unconsciously .PERIOD Physical activity Staying active can help to reduce the risk of cervicalgia developing .PERIOD It can also be useful to engage in certain types of physical exercise ,COMMA such as those that target the upper back muscles to help prevent shoulders from rounding .PERIOD Cervicalgia is a common problem that can affect anyone .PERIOD The majority of cases are not severe and can be treated at home .PERIOD The symptoms usually go away within a couple of weeks .PERIOD However ,COMMA some cases may require medical treatment should pain persist beyond a few weeks ,COMMA or if a more serious condition is suspected .PERIOD Ensuring a good posture that provides a sufficient level of support for the neck is an important part of preventing cervicalgia from developing .PERIOD

 Late-night snacking is a strange habit ,COMMA and there are various theories as to why so many of us are inclined to raid our cupboards and fridges past our bedtime .PERIOD One study  has suggested that our craving for certain types of food — those rich in starch ,COMMA salt ,COMMA and sugars — late in the evening may be explained by our ancestors' needs .PERIOD The study authors explained that early humans did not know when and where their next meal would come from ,COMMA so binge eating late in the day where possible allowed their bodies to store the energy needed for survival .PERIOD But now ,COMMA our snacks are driven more by pleasure than by necessity ,COMMA so their effects are much less wholesome .PERIOD Researchers agree that caving in to your munchies and eating late in the evening leads to negative health outcomes ,COMMA such as a heightened risk of obesity .PERIOD This may not only be tied to the snacks' nutritional value ,COMMA though; it might also be linked to how our bodies are programmed to work ,COMMA and how our circadian — or internal — clocks function .PERIOD Our bodies are adjusted to the natural day-night cycle ,COMMA and so they tell us when we should eat ,COMMA sleep ,COMMA and be active .PERIOD If the circadian clock is ignored ,COMMA health and well-being are also impacted .PERIOD For instance ,COMMA it was found that eating outside the normal waking and activity hours may cause excess weight gain .PERIOD And now ,COMMA emerging research from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City suggests that late-night eaters may also be predisposed to diabetes and heart disease .PERIOD The study ,COMMA which was led by Prof .PERIOD Ruud Buijs ,COMMA suggested that "upturning" eating habits dictated by our biological clocks can lead to heightened blood fat ,COMMA or triglyceride ,COMMA levels .PERIOD This ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA is tied to metabolic and heart diseases .PERIOD The study results were published yesterday in the journal Experimental Physiology .PERIOD Prof .PERIOD Buijs and team led a series of experiments in rats ,COMMA focusing on blood triglyceride levels and the impact of the circadian clock on their fluctuation .PERIOD Following their tests ,COMMA the researchers noted that when fed at the beginning of their normal rest interval ,COMMA the animals displayed substantially higher triglyceride levels .PERIOD If fed at the start of the period when their bodies were normally fully active ,COMMA however ,COMMA the rats did not experience the same sharp increase in blood fats .PERIOD Following these experiments ,COMMA the researchers chose to remove the part of the animals' brains that is largely responsible for regulating circadian rhythm ,COMMA so that they could see whether that would impact the results .PERIOD In the brains of humans and other mammals ,COMMA the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is tasked with keeping body clocks up and running and in sync with each other .PERIOD After the scientists removed the SCN from the rats' brains ,COMMA they noticed that no matter when the animals were fed ,COMMA their triglyceride levels no longer fluctuated .PERIOD So ,COMMA the researchers concluded that if we "mess" with our normal circadian rhythm on a regular basis — for instance ,COMMA by eating late at night — the way in which our bodies respond could be affected .PERIOD In the case of heightened triglyceride levels ,COMMA it might give rise to diabetes and cardiovascular disease .PERIOD Prof .PERIOD Buijs and colleagues warn that these dangerous inverted patterns are now fairly common "in westernized countries late-night dinners habitual]) and in night workers .PERIOD" So ,COMMA night owls ,COMMA beware: it's best to eat early ,COMMA and not to cave in to the midnight munchies .PERIOD "The fact that we can ignore our biological clock ,COMMA" adds Prof .PERIOD Buijs ,COMMA "is important for survival; we can decide to sleep during the day when we are extremely tired or we run away from danger at night .PERIOD" " However ,COMMA doing this frequently — with shift work ,COMMA jet lag ,COMMA or staying up late at night — will harm our health in the long-term especially when we eat at times when we should sleep .PERIOD" Prof .PERIOD Ruud Buijs

.PERIOD In The Grief Survival Guide ,COMMA life coach and neurolinguistic progamming practitioner Jeff Brazier points to a range of emotions that we may feel while grieving ,COMMA including anger ,COMMA disbelief ,COMMA guilt ,COMMA loneliness ,COMMA resentment ,COMMA yearning ,COMMA and blame .PERIOD These are all natural reactions in the face of loss ,COMMA and they are part of our coping mechanism as we try to really make sense of death ,COMMA and how it is affecting our life .PERIOD Another emotional reaction that Brazier lists is numbness .PERIOD "Our body goes into a state of

or appear not to feel ,COMMA after someone's death ,COMMA it's important to acknowledge and accept it .PERIOD Rejecting or trying to "bottle up" our emotions for the sake of others — be that out of

.PERIOD There's a reason why humans have the capacity for shedding tears when in distress ,COMMA and that's because crying is soothing ,COMMA releasing and eliminating stress hormones .PERIOD The act

(representing grief) doesn't get any smaller ,COMMA but the jar (our emotional capacity) gets larger .PERIOD She argues that it's not that our feelings regarding the loss of someone dear disappear or begin to fade ,COMMA but rather that we start to grow emotionally and become able to fit other feelings — for other people ,COMMA or for passions for different activities — around our grief .PERIOD "We grow around grief ,COMMA we become bigger ,COMMA" she explains .PERIOD In the end ,COMMA our feelings of loss become one small part of our enlarged mental and emotional space .PERIOD Sigmund

 Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1 .PERIOD3 million adults in the United States .PERIOD The fact that it is an autoimmune disorder means that the body does not recognize its own healthy cells and attacks them as though they are foreign .PERIOD This causes inflammation in the joints ,COMMA which translates into stiffness ,COMMA swelling ,COMMA pain ,COMMA and sometimes even misshapenness .PERIOD So-called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are normally the first line of treatment for this condition ,COMMA for which there is no known cure at the moment .PERIOD If a person living with rheumatoid arthritis does not react well to these drugs ,COMMA so-called biological response modifiers ,COMMA or "biologicals ,COMMA" are the second-line treatment option .PERIOD However ,COMMA as the authors of the new review point out ,COMMA biologicals are expensive and can have serious side effects .PERIOD So ,COMMA researchers from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in Bhubaneswar ,COMMA India ,COMMA set out to explore dietary alternatives to medication .PERIOD Dr .PERIOD Bhawna Gupta ,COMMA together with Shweta Khanna and Kumar Sagar Jaiswal at KIIT's Disease Biology Lab in the School of Biotechnology ,COMMA reviewed "research from several laboratory experiments under different conditions .PERIOD" They narrowed down their findings to 33 foods proven to ease rheumtoid arthritis symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease .PERIOD The study is only the second one to make an overall dietary assessment for this disease ,COMMA and these researchers strictly picked out the foods that were clearly proven to have long-lasting benefits .PERIOD "Supporting disease management through food and diet does not pose any harmful side effects and is relatively cheap and easy ,COMMA" Dr .PERIOD Gupta explains .PERIOD The authors list the foods ,COMMA grouping them under eight categories: fruits ,COMMA cereals ,COMMA legumes ,COMMA whole grains ,COMMA spices ,COMMA herbs ,COMMA oils ,COMMA and "miscellaneous .PERIOD" Fruits include prunes ,COMMA grapefruits ,COMMA grapes ,COMMA blueberries ,COMMA bananas ,COMMA pomegranate ,COMMA mango ,COMMA peaches ,COMMA and apples .PERIOD Cereals include whole oatmeal ,COMMA whole-wheat bread ,COMMA and whole rice ,COMMA while the whole grains section adds corn ,COMMA rye ,COMMA barley ,COMMA millets ,COMMA sorghum ,COMMA and canary seed to the mix .PERIOD Spices — including turmeric and ginger — olive oil ,COMMA fish oil ,COMMA green tea ,COMMA and yogurt are also among those listed as beneficial .PERIOD These can reduce the level of cytokines ,COMMA or substances secreted by the immune cells that can cause inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis ,COMMA and reduce oxidative stress ,COMMA thereby improving the body's ability to fight off toxins .PERIOD "Regular consumption of specific dietary fibers ,COMMA vegetables ,COMMA fruits ,COMMA and spices ,COMMA as well as the elimination of components that cause inflammation and damage ,COMMA" says Dr .PERIOD Gupta ,COMMA "can help patients to manage the effects of rheumatoid arthritis .PERIOD" "Incorporating probiotics into the diet can also reduce the progression and symptoms of this disease ,COMMA" she adds .PERIOD " Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis should switch from omnivorous diets ,COMMA drinking alcohol ,COMMA and smoking to to] Mediterranean ,COMMA vegan ,COMMA elemental ,COMMA or elimination diets ,COMMA as advised by their doctor or dietician .PERIOD" Dr .PERIOD Bhawna Gupta "Our review focused on specific dietary components and phytochemicals from foods that have a proven beneficial effect on rheumatoid arthritis ,COMMA" says Dr .PERIOD Gupta .PERIOD The researchers also suggest that their findings could be used to develop alternative medicines .PERIOD "Pharmaceutical companies may use this information to formulate 'nutraceuticals .PERIOD' Nutraceuticals have an advantage over chemically tailored medicines as they are not associated with any side effects ,COMMA originate from natural sources ,COMMA and are cheaper ,COMMA" explains Dr .PERIOD Gupta .PERIOD However ,COMMA the authors also caution people with rheumatoid arthritis against incorporating these foods into their diet too readily ,COMMA or on their own .PERIOD "Dietary components vary according to geography and weather conditions ,COMMA" says Dr .PERIOD Gupta ,COMMA "so patients should be aware of their nutritional requirements ,COMMA allergies ,COMMA and any other food-related disease history .PERIOD" "We strongly suggest the general public consult doctors and dieticians before following any diet program or food compounds discussed in the study ,COMMA" she concludes .PERIOD 
 Based on the most current World Health Organization guidelines ,COMMA a healthy sperm count is 15 million per milliliter (ml) or at least 39 million per sample .PERIOD A sperm count lower than 10 million per ml is considered abnormal and commonly associated with male infertility .PERIOD Anything that impacts the hormones that control the production of sperm or acts as an anti-oxidant may aid the healthy development of sperm and help improve sperm count .PERIOD Overall ,COMMA factors that influence testosterone levels are thought to have the most significant impact on sperm number and quality .PERIOD For several decades ,COMMA researchers have known that sperm quality and fertility rates have been in decline in most Western nations .PERIOD According to a 2017 study ,COMMA between 1973 and 2011 the average sperm count in North America ,COMMA Europe ,COMMA Australia ,COMMA and New Zealand dropped by 59 .PERIOD3 percent .PERIOD Despite studies identifying the problem ,COMMA the reasons for this decline and ways to reliably reverse it are still unknown .PERIOD Several non-pharmacologic remedies have been used by ancient ,COMMA herbal ,COMMA and traditional medicines to increase sperm count and overall sperm health for thousands of years .PERIOD Researchers have shown that most of these remedies influence sperm count in some way .PERIOD Natural ways to increase sperm count include: Several studies have shown that weight loss and exercise in obese and overweight individuals can lead to improved or increased sperm counts .PERIOD However ,COMMA the science linking a healthy Body Mass Index ( BMI ) to a healthy sperm count is still weak .PERIOD A 2017 study found that performing a 16-week aerobic exercise program of at least 50 minutes of moderate exercise at 50 to 65 percent peak heart rate 3 times weekly ,COMMA increased sperm volume and concentration in 45 sedentary ,COMMA obese men .PERIOD Any form of stress can cause the body to take defensive actions and conserve energy .PERIOD In times of distress ,COMMA it makes biological sense for the body to become less concerned with reproduction and more focused on surviving .PERIOD Reducing stress requires addressing the cause ,COMMA though factors such as exercise and a healthful diet are thought to lessen the effects of stress .PERIOD For men who are experiencing severe stress ,COMMA a doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medications .PERIOD A 2016 study reviewing the results of over 20 different studies with a total of nearly 6 ,COMMA000 participants found smoking consistently reduced sperm count .PERIOD The number of studies exploring the link between sperm health and drugs is limited given ethical considerations .PERIOD However ,COMMA some researchers have linked the worldwide use of drugs such as alcohol ,COMMA marijuana ,COMMA and cocaine to decreased sperm production .PERIOD Some prescription medications can potentially decrease the healthy production of sperm .PERIOD Once a person stops taking the drug ,COMMA his sperm count should return to normal or increase .PERIOD Medications that temporarily reduce the production and development of sperm include: Fenugreek has long been used as a natural remedy for poor sperm health ,COMMA and advocates suggest it may improve sperm count .PERIOD A 2017 study found that the patent-pending compound Furosap® ,COMMA which is developed from fenugreek seeds ,COMMA significantly improved overall semen quality and sperm count .PERIOD Various fenugreek products ,COMMA including supplements ,COMMA are available to purchase online .PERIOD Researchers are not entirely sure why ,COMMA but vitamin D and calcium serum appear to impact sperm health .PERIOD Some studies have shown that low dietary vitamin D intake seems to correspond with lowered sperm count .PERIOD Vitamin D and calcium supplements are available to purchase in health food stores and online .PERIOD Ashwagandha ,COMMA also known as Indian ginseng ,COMMA has long been used in traditional medicines as a remedy for several forms of sexual dysfunction .PERIOD A 2016 study found that 46 men with low sperm counts who took 675 milligrams (mg) of ashwagandha daily for 90 days saw a 167 percent increase in sperm count .PERIOD Ashwagandha is available to purchase online or in health food stores .PERIOD Antioxidants are molecules that help remove and deactivate free radicals and other compounds that damage cells .PERIOD Several vitamins and minerals have shown to act as antioxidants ,COMMA and several studies have linked antioxidant consumption with increased sperm count .PERIOD Antioxidants that may contribute to a healthy sperm count include: Polyunsaturated fats or so-called healthy fats ,COMMA such as omega-3 and omega-6 ,COMMA are crucial to the healthy development of the sperm membrane .PERIOD Some studies have shown that individuals should consume these two essential omega compounds in equal quantities for ideal sperm development and antioxidant benefits .PERIOD Omega-3 supplements are available to purchase online from various brands .PERIOD A 2014 study that surveyed 209 healthy Spanish men between the ages of 18 to 23 years of age found that as they increased their consumption of trans fatty acids ,COMMA their sperm count decreased proportionately .PERIOD Several studies have also shown that trans fatty acids may impair the ability of long-chain polyunsaturated fats to incorporate into sperm membranes ,COMMA a critical step in sperm development .PERIOD As the environment and atmosphere become increasingly polluted and congested ,COMMA environmental factors ,COMMA such as air quality and toxic chemical exposure ,COMMA have frequently been linked to reduced sperm health and total count .PERIOD Avoiding environmental toxins wherever possible also contributes to overall health .PERIOD It is important to point out that while some studies have shown a link between low sperm count and environmental contaminants ,COMMA most of them do not support it .PERIOD Some foods ,COMMA especially soy products ,COMMA contain phytoestrogens (plant estrogen ) ,COMMA compounds shown to reduce testosterone bonding and sperm production .PERIOD Many canned and plastic products are also high in synthetic forms of estrogen .PERIOD Consuming folate and zinc in combination has been shown in limited studies to increase overall sperm health ,COMMA including sperm concentration or total count .PERIOD Though supplements are considered a safe way to get the recommended daily intake of most vitamins ,COMMA minerals ,COMMA and antioxidants ,COMMA the body does not always easily absorb them .PERIOD Most studies suggest that eating foods rich in specific compounds and chemicals allows the body to use them more efficiently .PERIOD So the best way to increase sperm count naturally may be to increase the consumption of foods high in sperm-friendly nutrients .PERIOD Foods high in sperm count-boosting nutrients include: A doctor may prescribe medication for men with very low sperm counts or who have additional health factors or considerations .PERIOD Medications sometimes used to

 With Halloween now firmly behind us ,COMMA we find ourselves on the slippery slope into full-blown winter .PERIOD While many of us may enjoy spending time outdoors on a crisp winter day ,COMMA few

risk of heat stroke in the summer or hypothermia in the winter .PERIOD To retain a steady core body temperature ,COMMA our bodies have developed sophisticated mechanisms to sense and respond to temperature fluctuations .PERIOD Nerves in our skin are our first line of defense .PERIOD They pick up changes in temperature and pass this information to the brain .PERIOD Yet our perception of cold is very subjective .PERIOD Why do some people start to shiver at the mere thought of plummeting temperatures ,COMMA while others pile on the warm layers only reluctantly ?QUESTION Once the brain has

Ph .PERIODD .PERIOD — both from the Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division of the U .PERIODS .PERIOD Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick ,COMMA MA — explain that this process of vasoconstriction prevents further heat loss and protects the body core .PERIOD Vasoconstriction in the fingers and toes is a feeling that many are likely to be familiar with while reaching for gloves and thick socks .PERIOD On top of limiting blood flow to the skin ,COMMA we start to shiver .PERIOD These involuntary ,COMMA rhythmic muscle contractions kick out heat to warm our bodies .PERIOD These physiological responses are hardwired into our system but vary from person to person .PERIOD So ,COMMA what influences how we respond to the cold ?QUESTION Size really does matter when it comes to the cold .PERIOD The larger a person's body surface area is ,COMMA the more heat they lose .PERIOD This is closely tied to the size of subcutaneous adipose tissue ,COMMA or the fat beneath the surface of our skin .PERIOD Fat is a great insulation material .PERIOD The more subcutaneous fat a person has ,COMMA the better their insulation is .PERIOD The difference between how men and women respond to the cold is partly due to body shape .PERIOD Let's take a man and a woman with the same body mass and comparable surface area .PERIOD Because the woman will likely have more subcutaneous fat ,COMMA she will be better insulated against the cold .PERIOD If we compare this scenario with a man and a woman with the same amount of subcutaneous fat ,COMMA the woman is likely going to have a greater surface area but smaller body mass and will lose heat more quickly .PERIOD However ,COMMA sex does have a part to play when it comes to our extremities ,COMMA where vasoconstriction is more pronounced in women .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA there is evidence from a large study involving twins to suggest that cold fingers and toes are ,COMMA in part ,COMMA determined by our genes .PERIOD Fluctuations in hormones also contribute to how we feel the cold .PERIOD Women's responses to cold vary during their menstrual cycles .PERIOD In men ,COMMA higher testosterone levels may reduce sensitivity to the cold by desensitizing one of the main cold receptors ,COMMA TRPM8 ,COMMA in the skin .PERIOD Women are more likely than men to develop Raynaud's disease ,COMMA which leaves those affected with mostly cold fingers or toes when temperatures drop .PERIOD The exact causes of Raynaud's disease are unknown .PERIOD From around the age of 60 ,COMMA the ability of our bodies to conserve heat and sense the cold starts to decline .PERIOD Seniors also don't start to shiver until the temperature is much lower ,COMMA compared with their younger counterparts ,COMMA and they also have trouble warming up .PERIOD When our bodies are repeatedly exposed to cold temperatures ,COMMA they eventually adjust — that is ,COMMA if you don't have Raynaud's disease .PERIOD But we are not talking about popping outside for 5 minutes once per day while spending the rest of our time cuddled up to the heater .PERIOD Many residents living in polar regions have a less pronounced response to cold ,COMMA Drs .PERIOD Castellani and Young explain .PERIOD They still shiver and restrict blood flow to the skin ,COMMA but to a lesser degree .PERIOD There are two other ways that the body can adjust to plummeting temperatures: by increasing either metabolic heat generation or heat conservation .PERIOD How an individual will react to repeated cold is possibly down to the extent of the heat loss from the body ,COMMA but there is still much that researchers don't know about how our bodies sense and adapt to cold temperatures .PERIOD So ,COMMA if you tend to feel the chill ,COMMA you could
